# Linux Configuration Files (dotfiles)

## Origin
Everybody seems to have stocked their dotfiles here so here I am.
Might help for getting some inspiration when the web put you off track.

Might help me as a memory refresher when I messed up once more and can't figure out the poorly documented stuff once again.

## Contents
For now the following has been included:
- zsh environment
- X11 Configuration
- tmux setup
- dunst Configuration
- tig Configuration
- qutebrowser
- newsboat

Tried to add my nvim (neovim) setup but the lua files wouldn't stick to the bare dotfiles repo . . . .
Will try to remember this README file when things get added.

Kind Regards,
